# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Claude Code reads only `CLAUDE.md`, so the `@AGENTS.md` line below imports the canonical shared
block (which Cursor reads from `AGENTS.md` natively). Estate-wide guidance lives there;
repo-specific guidance follows below.

## Repo

Template repository for Rheged Studio npm packages. It ships a minimal, buildable pnpm + TypeScript ESM skeleton plus the shared workflow/release shell, so a new package can be generated and released without rebuilding the infrastructure each time.

The one-time org/repo settings that stand this up as a GitHub Template repository — and the settings every spawned repo inherits (Template flag, `GO/NO GO` ruleset, npm OIDC, `npm-release` environment, orchestrator onboarding, Claude review) — live in the [Setup section of the README](README.md#setup), the single source of truth for the non-copied setup. The list below covers the per-package code edits inside a generated repo, plus the non-copied repo/org steps (each cross-links its README subsection rather than duplicating the detail).

When generating a package from this template, **run the `initialise-package-repo` skill** in the new repo (see "## Agent skills" below, and A-663). It drives the whole post-generation checklist below in one idempotent, dry-run-first pass — so the individual steps here are the _reference_ for what it does, not a manual walk you have to perform by hand. The one thing it deliberately leaves to you is authoring the real `src/` API.

The skill **automates**:

- **Renames the `package.json` identity** — `name` (placeholder `@rheged-studio/npm-package-template`), `description`, `keywords`, `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs` — deriving name/URLs from `gh repo view` and prompting for `description`/`keywords`.
- **Re-seeds `.release-please-manifest.json`** so `"."` matches the new package's starting `package.json` version (the template ships `"0.0.0"`). Leaving it stale is the #1 release-please failure mode. `release-please-config.json` itself needs no edit.
- **Resets `changelog/` to just its `README.md`.** The template dogfoods its own changelog process, so `changelog/` accumulates dated entries documenting the _template's own_ development. "Use this template" copies them into the generated repo, where they are unrelated noise — and because they are version-less, the post-merge enricher would stamp the new package's first version onto them and sweep them into its first release notes (it stamps _every_ version-less entry, not just the current PR's). The skill deletes every dated entry, keeping only `README.md`; the template's entries are preserved in its own git history, and the repo's own first real entry is written by `/send-it`.
- **Points `infrastructure/repo-config.yaml`** at the new package (scope, default branch) where values differ, preserving comments.
- **Pulls the shared skills** via `npx skills add … --copy` from `rheged-studio/agent-skills` for the locked set (both Claude Code and Cursor trees) — pull-on-instantiation (A-776). Committed copies in the template are bootstrap only; the repo-local `initialise-package-repo` scaffolder is never overwritten.
- **Clears the template-seed skill-config gitignore** (A-812) so spawned consumers can commit the resolved per-skill `config.json` files — then **generates those configs** by wrapping the `initialise-skills` skill (only the neutral `config.example.json` ships in the vendored bundles). Runs **after** the skills pull so configs match the pulled versions.
- **Re-creates the `GO/NO GO` required-check ruleset** (rulesets are **not** copied by "Use this template") — pinned to the GitHub Actions integration, **with road-runner-bot as a bypass actor** so `pkg-release.yml`'s `changelog-enrich` write-back to `main` succeeds (A-1019; see "CI gate (`GO/NO GO`)" below). See [README → the required-check ruleset](README.md#the-required-check-ruleset).
- **Ensures the Trunk changelog bypass** (ADR 0004 / A-808) — repo-level `Trunk` ruleset with `road-runner-bot` as a bypass actor so `pkg-release.yml`'s `changelog-enrich` job can push `changelog/**`. Creates `Trunk` when absent.
- **Creates the `main`-restricted `npm-release` environment** (not copied; without it the OIDC publish has nowhere to deploy from). See [README → the npm-release environment](README.md#the-npm-release-environment).
- **Enables the Release workflow** (`gh workflow enable Release`, done last — after the environment exists).

The skill **verifies-and-reports** (needs org/browser/cross-repo privilege it can't take on itself), so you finish these by hand:

- **Author the real `src/` API** — replace everything under `src/`; `src/index.ts` is the published entry point. The build/lint/release shell does not change. (Lint configs — `eslint.config.ts` extending `@rheged-studio/eslint-config`, `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` extending `@rheged-studio/markdownlint-config` — are inherited as-is; extend `eslint.config.ts` only for the opt-in presets you need: `testing`, `frameworkRouting`, `astro`, `sanity`, `storybook`, `tableComponents`.)
- **Onboard the release-orchestrator** — the template ships every repo-side prerequisite, and road-runner-bot + `ROADRUNNER_*` are now provisioned org-wide (A-945), so this reduces to a single step: **add the repo to the orchestrator's `matrix.repo`** (A-648). The old per-repo "install road-runner-bot" and "grant `ROADRUNNER_*` selected access" (A-821) steps no longer apply. See [README → release-orchestrator onboarding](README.md#release-orchestrator-onboarding).
- **Verify the Claude review prerequisites** — `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret **and** the Claude GitHub App on the repo (the App install fixes the `git fetch … could not read Username` failure — A-621 / A-636). Preferably both are org-wide, in which case just confirm inheritance. See [README → Claude review prerequisites](README.md#claude-review-prerequisites).
- **Bootstrap npm OIDC** — the manual first publish (passkey/WebAuthn), then the `v<initial>` git tag + GitHub release (so release-please has a baseline — A-1019), then configuring the Trusted Publisher. See [README → npm OIDC](README.md#npm-oidc-trusted-publishing) and "Bootstrap publish" below.

## Decisions live in Linear, not ADRs

Architectural and process decisions for this template — and for every repo spawned from it —
are recorded as **Linear issues**, not as in-repo ADR files. The issue IDs threaded through
this document and the code comments (e.g. `A-326`, `A-328`, `A-447`, `A-639`) are the durable
decision record: follow the ID to Linear for the full rationale. A repo generated from the
template inherits this convention — capture new decisions as Linear issues and reference their
IDs in commits, PR bodies, and comments rather than adding a `docs/adr/` tree. The template
itself is catalogued in the Open Source initiative in Linear (A-238).

## Package manager and Node

pnpm, pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`. Node 22 required (`.nvmrc`, `engines.node: ">=22"`, `engine-strict=true` in `.npmrc`).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install        # install deps (runs prepare → husky hook install)
pnpm run build      # tsc → dist/ (the published artifact; consumers import from dist)
pnpm tsc            # type-check only — src/ (no emit) + infrastructure/ via tsconfig.tools.json
pnpm lint           # eslint over src/**
pnpm lint:fix       # auto-fix
pnpm lint:md        # markdownlint (CI: lint reusable caller)
pnpm lint:yaml      # yamllint . (semantic YAML check; warnings non-blocking)
pnpm lint:workflows # actionlint on .github/workflows/
pnpm lint:sh        # shellcheck on infrastructure/scripts/*.sh + .husky/*
pnpm test           # vitest run (infrastructure/tests/**/*.test.ts)
pnpm test:watch     # vitest in watch mode
pnpm test:sh        # bats on infrastructure/tests/*.bats
pnpm validate:changelog # schema-check changelog/*.md via changelog-core (CI: lint reusable caller)
pnpm format         # prettier write
pnpm clean          # remove node_modules + dist
```

## Agent skills

This repo adopts the shared `@rheged-studio/agent-skills` bundles, installed via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) under `.claude/skills/` (mirrored to `.agents/skills/` for Cursor). They replace the bespoke `.claude/commands/send-it.md` shim that previously lived here. The installed skills are:

- **`/send-it`** — the all-in-one finisher: commits uncommitted work as atomic Conventional Commits, runs the change-gated lint preflight, writes a dated `changelog/` entry (for **every** PR — "record everything, filter later"; non-release entries stay version-less), composes the Conventional Commits PR title, pushes, opens or updates a draft PR, and moves linked Linear issues to In Review. Prefer it over hand-rolled `git commit` + `git push` + `gh pr create`.
- **`/preflight`** — the change-gated, branch-scoped lint preflight (delegated to by `/send-it`).
- **`/changelog`** — authors, refreshes, or repairs the dated `changelog/` entry for the current branch (delegated to by `/send-it`).
- **`/linear-sync`** — transitions the Linear issue(s) linked to the current branch to a target workflow state.
- **`/cleanup-repo`** — prunes merged Git branches and worktrees, then clears filesystem cruft, behind a single confirmation gate.
- **`/triage-pr`** — drives a PR from draft-with-failing-CI to merge-ready.

One further skill is **repo-local**, not from the shared bundle (it lives only in this template's `.claude/skills/` + `.agents/skills/`, is not in `skills-lock.json`, and travels into spawned repos via "Use this template"):

- **`/initialise-package-repo`** — the one-shot, idempotent post-generation setup for a repo freshly spawned from this template (A-663 / A-776). Resets `changelog/` to just its README (the changelog-poisoning fix), re-seeds `.release-please-manifest.json`, rewrites the `package.json` identity + `infrastructure/repo-config.yaml` from the repo's own facts, **pulls the shared skills** via `npx skills add … --copy`, **wraps and runs `initialise-skills`** to generate every skill's `config.json`, and applies the non-copied GitHub settings (`npm-release` environment, `GO/NO GO` ruleset with the road-runner-bot bypass, Trunk changelog bypass, enabling Release) via `gh api` behind a confirmation gate — then verifies-and-reports the org/browser steps it can't automate. It **is** the executable form of the generation checklist at the top of this file. Dry-run first, safe to re-run.

Each shared-bundle skill ships a neutral `config.example.json`. The real `config.json` is **generated on install, then committed in the consumer** (agent-skills v1.1.0 generated-config model / A-812). The template seed gitignores `.claude/skills/*/config.json` and `.agents/skills/*/config.json` so "Use this template" never copies a local resolved config into a new repo; `/initialise-package-repo` strips those ignore lines, runs `initialise-skills`, and the spawned package **commits** the resulting configs. Run `initialise-skills` again after a fresh install or a repo-fact change (`dist` as the shippable surface, `A` as the Linear issue key); it is idempotent (a second dry-run is a no-op).

**v1.1.0 behavioural changes (A-640).** Riding along with the v1.1.0 re-sync: `/send-it` decides release-type by the change's **semantic category** (the Conventional-Commit type of the work it commits), not by which paths the diff touches — the old `changelogScope`/`shippablePaths`-as-gate model is gone (`shippablePaths` is now advisory only); `/preflight` gains a `blockOnWarnings` knob (defaults to errors-only blocking); `/changelog` add-links is branch-scoped by default.

**Template-propagation note (A-776).** Committed shared skill bundles (installed with `--copy`) remain in this template as **bootstrap** so `/initialise-package-repo` can run immediately after "Use this template". A spawned package then **pulls** the locked shared set once via `npx skills add … --copy` (both agents) before `initialise-skills` materialises per-skill `config.json` — pull-on-instantiation, not inheritance of a frozen tree with no refresh. This template is **not** a skills push-fan-out consumer (dropped in A-774); do not re-add it to the hourly matrix. Stripping the committed bundles entirely in favour of a global install is tracked separately (A-790, blocked on A-781) and is out of scope here. The separate getting-started / scaffold track (A-467) must **not** re-vendor or duplicate these bundles outside that pull path.

## Source layout

TypeScript source lives under `src/`, compiled by `tsc` to `dist/` (declarations + source maps). Only `dist/` is published (`files: ["dist"]`); `exports`/`main`/`module`/`types` all point into it. The workflow/release shell — `.github/`, `infrastructure/`, `.husky/`, `changelog/`, `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json` — is **not** part of the published artifact.

## Build / type-check / lint topology

The published `dist/` must contain **only** the compiled `src/`, but the TypeScript tooling under `infrastructure/` still needs type-checking and type-aware linting. Three tsconfigs keep those concerns separate:

- **`tsconfig.json`** — the build config. `rootDir: ./src`, `include: ["src/**/*.ts"]`, emits to `dist/`. `pnpm build` (`tsc`) uses it, so `dist/` stays src-only. Do **not** widen its `include` to "fix" linting — that re-emits infra into `dist/`.
- **`tsconfig.tools.json`** — `noEmit`, `extends ./tsconfig.json`, covers `eslint.config.ts`, `infrastructure/scripts/**`, `infrastructure/tests/**`, `vitest.config.ts`. `pnpm tsc` runs it as a second pass to type-check the shell, tests, and the ESLint config.
- **`tsconfig.eslint.json`** — `noEmit`, the linter's project. Spans `src/**` + the infra `.ts`. `eslint.config.ts` pins `parserOptions.project` to it so the base preset's type-aware rules (`project: true`) resolve every linted file regardless of directory. Without this pin ESLint would fail with "file not found by the project service" on infra files (they aren't in the src-only `tsconfig.json`). The ESLint config itself is **not** in this project — the preset's global ignores exclude `eslint.config.ts` from linting, so it is type-checked only via `tsconfig.tools.json`.

`extends` does **not** inherit `include`/`exclude` — only `compilerOptions` — so the two extra configs restate their own `include`/`exclude`.

## Linting and formatting

This package dogfoods the org's own shared configs:

- **ESLint** — `eslint.config.ts` consumes `@rheged-studio/eslint-config`, composing the `base` stack plus the `typescript` overrides, then adds two local blocks: an `infrastructure/**/*.ts` override (`complexity: off` + `import/no-extraneous-dependencies` with `devDependencies: true`, since the shell scripts legitimately import devDeps), and the `tsconfig.eslint.json` project pin (see above). The preset also re-exports opt-in presets (`testing`, `frameworkRouting`, `astro`, `sanity`, `storybook`, `tableComponents`) — pull them in as a generated package needs them. The config is authored in `.ts` (loaded by `jiti`, a devDependency ESLint v9.18+ requires for TypeScript config) and wrapped in `defineConfig` from `eslint/config`, so the whole array — including the two local override blocks — is type-checked against the preset's shipped types (`./dist/index.d.ts`) instead of only failing at lint-run time. `pnpm tsc` type-checks it via `tsconfig.tools.json`.
- **Markdown** — `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` extends `@rheged-studio/markdownlint-config`. Pre-commit auto-fixes staged `**/*.{md,mdx}` via lint-staged (`|| true`, so it never blocks); the `lint` reusable caller (markdown lane) enforces. (There is no root `CHANGELOG.md` to exclude — release-please runs with `skip-changelog`.)
- **Prettier** — `pnpm format` runs `prettier --write .`; `.prettierignore` excludes `node_modules`, `dist`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and `tsconfig.json`.

## GitHub Actions repo config

Non-secret knobs shared by `ci.yml` and `pkg-release.yml` live in **`infrastructure/repo-config.yaml`**, loaded at runtime via `reusable-load-repo-config.yml@v1` (A-779), which allowlist-validates every value before writing it to `GITHUB_OUTPUT` (guards newline/`=` injection; A-330).

| Key                         | Purpose                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultBranch`             | Canonical default branch; keep in sync with static `on:` triggers (GitHub cannot derive `on.push.branches` from this file). |
| `nodeVersionFile`           | Passed to `actions/setup-node` `node-version-file`.                                                                         |
| `npmRegistryUrl`            | Public npm registry (`setup-node` when talking to npmjs).                                                                   |
| `npmScope`                  | Package scope; must equal the owning GitHub org so `setup-node` scopes `.npmrc` for the GitHub Packages leg.                |
| `githubPackagesRegistryUrl` | GitHub Packages npm registry (`https://npm.pkg.github.com`) — the secondary publish target.                                 |

Secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN`), OIDC Trusted Publishing, and release-please behaviour are unchanged — not in this file. **No bot key ships in the template.**

## Local hooks

`pnpm install` runs `prepare` (`husky`), which installs the hooks under `.husky/`. Three hooks fire:

- **`pre-commit`** — runs `pnpm lint-staged`. Auto-fixes only the staged files: `prettier --write` for everything, `eslint --fix` for `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,mjs,cjs}`, `sort-package-json` + `eslint --fix` for `**/package.json`, `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` for `**/*.{md,mdx}`, `yamllint` (read-only check) for `**/*.{yml,yaml}`, `actionlint` (read-only check) for `.github/workflows/*.{yml,yaml}`. Each task is wrapped in `bash -c '… "$@" --` so the staged file paths are passed through. The auto-fixers carry an `|| true` fallback so they never block — CI is the gate. The two YAML linters are best-effort: if the tool isn't on `PATH` locally, the hook prints a platform-appropriate install hint and skips. CI still enforces.
- **`commit-msg`** — strips any `Co-Authored-By: Claude … <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer. Backstops the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` rule (Claude is tooling, not a contributor).
- **`pre-push`** — blocks direct pushes to `main`; humans should use `/send-it` to open a PR. Bot users (`github-actions[bot]`, `road-runner-bot[bot]`) and the release-please release commit (`chore(main): release <version>`) bypass. It also runs `pnpm lint:workflows` + `pnpm lint:yaml` as a last-line gate before CI, then a best-effort `commitlint --from origin/main --to HEAD` range check (A-1021) — skips with an installation hint if `@commitlint/cli` isn't available locally or if `origin/main` is not a resolvable ref; CI's `reusable-validate-commits` gate is still the authority. Config lives in `commitlint.config.mjs` extending `@rheged-studio/commitlint-config`.

Hooks are dormant in CI: `ci.yml` and the reusable release workflow (called by `pkg-release.yml`) set `HUSKY=0` so the `prepare` script no-ops during `pnpm install`.

To bypass any hook in an emergency: `git commit --no-verify` or `git push --no-verify` — not recommended.

## CI gate (`GO/NO GO`)

`ci.yml` ends with a single **`GO/NO GO`** aggregator job — the one stable, estate-canonical gate the release-orchestrator waits on (A-412/A-424). It `needs:` every real job (`config`, `lint`, `build-test`, `pr-title`, `changelog-completeness`), runs `if: ${{ always() }}`, and a one-line `jq` verdict over `toJSON(needs)` succeeds **iff** every job `result` is `success` or `skipped`. The `lint` and `build-test` jobs are thin callers of the shared reusable workflows (see "Shared reusable CI callers" below); `config` is in `needs` so a config failure — which would skip the callers, and skips are accepted — still fails the gate directly.

- **Why a check-run, not a commit status.** The gate is the job's _intrinsic_ check-run, named `GO/NO GO`. A commit status is writable by any push-scoped token (forgeable); a **check-run can only be minted by a GitHub App** — here, the repo's own Actions run — so a push-scoped token or a fork contributor cannot forge it. Require it on `main` via a **ruleset pinned to the GitHub Actions integration** (`integration_id: 15368`), so nothing but this repo's Actions can satisfy it. Rulesets aren't copied by template generation — see the generation checklist.
- **road-runner-bot bypass (A-1019).** The `Require GO/NO GO gate` ruleset **must** list road-runner-bot as a bypass actor: `pkg-release.yml`'s `changelog-enrich` job pushes `changelog/**` directly to `main` after each merge and would otherwise be rejected by the required check (`GH013`). Human PRs still have to satisfy `GO/NO GO` — the bypass is scoped to the bot actor. The `Trunk` ruleset carries the same bypass for its pull-request/deletion/non-fast-forward rules. See [README → the required-check ruleset](README.md#the-required-check-ruleset).
- **Footguns (A-418).** The gate must **never** be path-filtered (a path-filtered required check sits Pending forever and blocks merges); `always()` is mandatory or the aggregator skips and never reports; the literal `/` and space must surface as `check_run.name == "GO/NO GO"` (they do — emoji/spaces already survive in `lint / Lint`). Fall back to explicit-create (`POST /check-runs`, Option A) only if the `/` ever misbehaves.
- **Gate name (A-419 / A-596 / A-437).** Clacks polls the `GO/NO GO` check-run only. A-419 opened a dual-accept window (`🔬 Build & Lint` **or** `GO/NO GO`); A-596 collapsed it to `GO/NO GO`-only once every served repo emitted it, and A-437 retired the old gate role. The caller swap (A-447) had already **removed** the `🔬 Build & Lint` context from this template — replaced by `lint / Lint` + `build-test / Build & Test`. Safe on _this_ repo regardless: Release is disabled, so nothing here waits on the orchestrator. `pr-title`'s name is _also_ the estate-pinned required-check context (A-405); don't tidy it.
- **Done (A-411 / A-447).** The `lint` and `build-test` jobs are now thin callers of `rheged-studio/shared-workflows`'s reusable `reusable-lint.yml` / `reusable-build-test.yml` (A-415/416). `pr-title` stays inline (its own track, A-428/A-403) and `release` stays inline (no reusable workflow yet, A-417). `GO/NO GO` stays put across the swap, which is exactly why it lives here (custom per-repo) and not upstream.

## Shared reusable CI callers (A-447)

The `lint` and `build-test` jobs in `ci.yml` are thin callers of the estate's shared reusable workflows — the template is the **reference consumer** that proves the pattern before the fleet rollout (A-420). Both are SHA-pinned to one commit (`9febdb1`, **v1.0.2**) so Dependabot bumps them together (A-446).

- **`lint`** → `reusable-lint.yml` runs ESLint + markdownlint + yamllint/actionlint + dated-changelog validation in one job (`lint / Lint`). Inputs: `eslint-args` passes **directory paths** (`src`), not globs — the Layer-1 action runs `eslint $ESLINT_ARGS` word-split with bash `globstar` off, so a `**` glob would mis-expand; directories let ESLint's flat config resolve the file set recursively. `infrastructure/scripts` is shell-only after A-808 (do not pass it — ESLint errors when every file under a directory is ignored). `markdown-globs` mirrors the `lint:md` script; `changelog-script: validate:changelog` (the repo's script name; the reusable default is `changelog:validate`). The yaml lane uses **actionlint 1.7.12** (the reusable default, owned upstream in lockstep per A-422 — _not_ the `1.7.5` the local `ensure-actionlint.sh` pins) and shared-workflows' **centralised `.yamllint.yml`** (A-438), so the repo's local `.yamllint.yml` now only feeds the pre-commit hook.
- **`build-test`** → `reusable-build-test.yml` runs build (verification) + Vitest + ShellCheck + bats (`build-test / Build & Test`). `typecheck: false` (CI runs no standalone `pnpm tsc` today). `shellcheck-paths` passes the scripts dir + the three extensionless husky hooks explicitly (the action `find`s `*.sh/*.bash` under directories but takes files literally). `bats: true` runs `pnpm exec bats` — which is why **`bats` is a devDependency** (`bats@1.13.0`, matching `ensure-bats.sh`'s pin); the tests are self-contained (no `bats-support`/`bats-assert`).
- **`config`** loads `repo-config.yaml` once and feeds `node-version-file` to the callers (and to `changelog-completeness`) via `needs` — caller jobs can't run a `load-repo-config` step inline. This is the caller-stub pattern: a generated package that changes `nodeVersionFile` has it flow through without editing the workflow.

The callers run on **all** branches including `release-please--*` (no skip), so the changelog lane validates the finalised entries before the release PR merges. Consequence: yaml/shellcheck/test/bats now also run on the release-please branch (the old inline `yaml-lint`/`infra` jobs skipped there) — harmless, `GO/NO GO` stays green.

The `ensure-actionlint.sh` / `ensure-yamllint.sh` / `ensure-bats.sh` scripts (and `requirements-yamllint.txt`) are **no longer run in CI** — those tools install inside the reusable workflows now. They are retained as unit-tested reference shell (still exercised by `pnpm test:sh`) and document the install-and-verify pattern.

## Validating workflows and YAML

Two non-Node tools augment Prettier's formatting pass with the semantic checks Prettier can't see (Actions schema, `${{ … }}` expression typos, duplicate keys, etc.). Since A-447, **CI runs them inside the `lint` reusable caller** (the yaml lane), not the inline jobs described here — so the install scripts below are now the **local/pre-commit + reference** path. Note the version split: the reusable workflow pins **actionlint 1.7.12** (and yamllint 1.37.1); the local `ensure-actionlint.sh` still pins **1.7.5**.

- **`actionlint` v1.7.5 (local)** — Go binary. Local install: `brew install actionlint` (macOS) or `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/v1.7.5/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)` elsewhere.
- **`yamllint` 1.37.1** — Python tool. Local install: `brew install yamllint` (macOS) or `pip install --user yamllint==1.37.1` elsewhere.

**Digest-pinned bootstraps (A-327).** The CI install scripts for these tools fetch-and-execute third-party code, so each is pinned by digest, not just a mutable tag:

- `ensure-actionlint.sh` fetches `download-actionlint.bash` from the **immutable commit SHA** of the v1.7.5 tag (not the `v1.7.5` tag), passes the version explicitly so it installs that exact release, then independently re-verifies the extracted binary against a pinned sha256 (enforced on the CI arch, linux/amd64). It also **version-gates the cached binary** and **drops the cache `restore-keys` fallback** (A-349), so a version bump forces a clean reinstall instead of silently restoring a stale binary.
- `ensure-bats.sh` verifies the downloaded release tarball against a pinned sha256 before extraction.
- `ensure-yamllint.sh` installs via `pip install --require-hashes -r infrastructure/requirements-yamllint.txt`, so pip refuses any artefact — yamllint or a transitive dep — whose digest isn't listed. Regenerate that file when bumping (see its header).

When bumping any of these, update the version **and** the matching digest/requirements together. The same install-and-verify discipline now lives in the shared reusable workflows' read-scoped jobs; it must never be added to the `release`/`publish-github-packages` jobs, which is what keeps a compromised upstream away from the publish identity.

Configuration: `.yamllint.yml` at the repo root extends defaults, demotes line-length / indentation to warnings (Prettier owns formatting), allows the GitHub Actions truthy values (`on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`), and ignores `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.turbo/`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`. **Local + pre-commit only** since A-447 — CI's yaml lane uses shared-workflows' centralised config (A-438). No `.actionlintrc.yaml` — defaults are fine for this repo.

Enforcement: pre-commit is best-effort (skip with install hint when missing); CI is the `lint` reusable caller's yaml lane (`lint / Lint`), always enforced. The local install-and-run logic for both tools lives in `infrastructure/scripts/ensure-yamllint.sh` and `ensure-actionlint.sh` — now CI-unused but kept as unit-tested reference (see `infrastructure/README.md`).

## Validating workflows locally with `act`

`actionlint` and `yamllint` catch schema and expression-level mistakes. They say nothing about whether a workflow actually _works_ end-to-end — Node/pnpm setup ordering, env propagation, conditional skips, step interdependencies. [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) closes that gap by running the workflow against your local Docker daemon so you can iterate without push-and-pray.

**Install:** `brew install act` (macOS) or `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh)` (Linux). Requires a running container engine — Docker Desktop, Colima, or podman. `pnpm act:list` is the smoke test: if it enumerates the jobs in `.github/workflows/`, you're set up.

**`.actrc`** at the repo root pins `ubuntu-latest` to `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` (Ubuntu 24.04-based, matching real `ubuntu-latest`). The default `act` image is intentionally minimal and silently breaks Node/pnpm setups, so don't remove this. Container architecture is deliberately **not** pinned — `act` defaults to the host arch (arm64 on Apple Silicon), which is fast and matches GHA's _results_ for this codebase even though GHA runners are amd64.

**Capability matrix** for the workflows (the build-once split is validated by static lint — actionlint/yamllint/shellcheck/bats green; the rows below describe expected `act` behaviour):

| Workflow / Job                          | Under `act` | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

pnpm act:ci             # run ci.yml as a PR event, using .github/act-events/pull_request.json
pnpm act:release:dry    # run pkg-release.yml — fetches the remote reusable workflow; build+pack run, then it stops at the OIDC-bound publish/provenance steps
```

The PR event fixture lives at `.github/act-events/pull_request.json` and sets `pull_request.head.ref` / `pull_request.base.ref` / `pull_request.title` so the changelog-completeness gate (`git diff …origin/${{ github.base_ref }}`) and the `pr-title` lint in `ci.yml` resolve against a real ref and title instead of `origin/`.

**Apple Silicon caveat:** arm64 default is fast (native, no emulation). To strictly mirror real `ubuntu-latest` (amd64) for one-off parity debugging, append `--container-architecture linux/amd64` (expect 3–5× slowdown via Rosetta/QEMU and a multi-minute first-run image pull).

**Post-push triage** (when CI runs remotely, after `/send-it`): `pnpm ci:list` shows recent runs, `pnpm ci:watch` streams the latest one, `pnpm ci:view` opens a specific run. All three require `gh auth login` first.

## `infrastructure/`

`act` validates workflow _wiring_ — that the YAML resolves, steps fire in order, env propagates. It says nothing about whether the logic _inside_ a `run:` block is correct. `infrastructure/` is the home for that logic: shell + TS extracted from workflow `run:` blocks, runnable and unit-tested in isolation. The full conventions document is `infrastructure/README.md`; the high-level rules:

- **Per-script language.** Shell + bats for CLI orchestration (`git`, `gh`, `jq`, `curl`, `pip`). TypeScript + vitest for parsing, branching, anything touching octokit. If a shell script grows past ~20 lines with conditionals, port to TS.
- **Inputs via env, not argv.** Workflows pass values through `env:`; tests mock by passing an env object. No shell quoting drama; clean test seam.
- **Pure functions exported for tests.** Each TS script exports the pure logic; `main()` wires it to real subprocesses. Tests inject a fake runner that records argv.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running with the same inputs is safe. The CI cache-hit branch of `ensure-yamllint.sh` / `ensure-actionlint.sh` / `ensure-bats.sh` is exactly this scenario.
- **Pinned versions in env defaults**, e.g. `ACTIONLINT_VERSION="${ACTIONLINT_VERSION:-1.7.5}"`. The workflow's cache-key still hard-codes the version separately — match them when bumping.

Changelog validate / completeness / enrich / finalise are provided by
`@rheged-studio/changelog-core` (`pnpm validate:changelog`,
`pnpm exec changelog-core check-completeness`). Post-merge write-back is the
`changelog-enrich` job in `pkg-release.yml` calling
`reusable-changelog-enrich.yml` (A-808 / A-821).

CI (A-447): the `build-test` reusable caller runs ShellCheck (`infrastructure/scripts` + the husky hooks), Vitest, and bats (`pnpm exec bats`, so `bats` is a devDependency) against this directory; the `lint` caller runs `validate:changelog`; the `changelog-completeness` job runs the completeness gate. Locally, `pnpm lint:sh` / `pnpm test:sh` skip with install hints if `shellcheck` / `bats` aren't on PATH — `pnpm test` (vitest) always runs because vitest is a node devDep.

> `eslint.config.ts` scopes a `devDependencies: true` + `complexity: off` override to `infrastructure/**` for the branchy ensure-\*/publish reference scripts.

When adding workflow-extracted tooling, write the test first, then wire from YAML as a one-liner: `run: pnpm tsx infrastructure/scripts/<name>.ts` or `run: bash infrastructure/scripts/<name>.sh`. (The bespoke `/send-it` slash command and its `infrastructure/send-it/` helpers were superseded by the shared `send-it` agent skill — see "## Agent skills"; its bump logic now lives in the bundle's `derive-bump.mjs`.)

## Dated changelog (`changelog/`)

The `changelog/` directory is the **only** changelog in the repo — there is no root `CHANGELOG.md` (release-please runs with `skip-changelog`, A-371). It keeps **one dated Markdown file per PR** — a browsable, per-change, machine-readable record (the `version` field, stamped at release only on release-triggering entries, ties an entry back to the published release it shipped in). The reusable release workflow (called by `pkg-release.yml`) sources its GitHub-release notes from the version-stamped entries. Full schema and lifecycle in **`changelog/README.md`**. The template ships only that README; the first real entry is written by `/send-it`.

Two-stage lifecycle — post-merge enrichment runs in-repo via
`reusable-changelog-enrich.yml` on every push to `main` (A-808 / A-821); the
orchestrator's inline finalise is retired later (A-801).

1. **PR-time** — `/send-it` writes `changelog/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>.md` with the PR-time fields (and empty enrichment placeholders) for **every** PR under the v1.1.0 "record everything, filter later" model — a non-release entry simply stays version-less and is filtered out of release notes. The entry merges to `main` with its PR and sits with placeholders until post-merge enrich / release finalise. CI's changelog-completeness gate enforces the one hard coupling: a release-triggering `feat`/`fix`/breaking PR title **must** carry an entry.
2. **Post-merge / release** — `pkg-release.yml`'s `changelog-enrich` job (`mode: finalise`) resolves the just-merged PR, fills `merged_at`/`commit`/`pr`/`stats` via `changelog-core enrich`, and stamps `version` via `changelog-core finalise` only when `package.json`'s version has no matching git tag (release-please cut). Write-back pushes only `changelog/**` as `road-runner-bot[bot]` (ADR 0004). Dormant on this template while Release is disabled; generated packages inherit the job when they enable Release.

`validate:changelog` (`pnpm exec changelog-core validate`) enforces the schema (CI: the `lint` reusable caller's changelog lane). Required frontmatter is relaxed to `title`/`created_at`/`category`/`breaking` so backfilled historical entries and in-flight entries both pass.

## Release workflow

> **Disabled on this template repo.** The template's `src/` is a placeholder that is never published, so the Release workflow is switched off here (`gh workflow disable Release`) to avoid a failing publish — and an auto-opened failure issue — on every push to `main`. The workflow file stays in the tree because it is part of the shell that generated packages inherit; only its execution on _this_ repo is suppressed. Re-enable with `gh workflow enable Release` (and in any repo generated from this template — see the generation checklist at the top). Everything below describes the workflow as it runs in a real, publishing package.
>
> **Thin caller (A-639).** The release workflow is `.github/workflows/pkg-release.yml` — a thin caller of the estate's shared `reusable-pkg-release.yml` (SHA-pinned to v1.0.2), mirroring eslint-config. A `config` job loads `infrastructure/repo-config.yaml` and passes `npm-scope` / `node-version-file` / the registry URLs to the reusable workflow, which holds all the release logic described below. The file is `pkg-release.yml` (npm Trusted Publishing binds its OIDC subject to repository + workflow **filename**, so configure the Trusted Publisher against `pkg-release.yml`), but the workflow **name** stays `Release` so `gh workflow enable/disable Release` still works.

There are two release modes — know which one you're in.

### Day-to-day releases (CI via OIDC)

Once the package exists on npm AND its Trusted Publisher is configured against this repo's `pkg-release.yml`, every release flows through CI:

1. Make changes on a feature branch; `/send-it` bundles, writes the dated `changelog/<slug>.md` entry (for every PR), sets a **Conventional Commits PR title** (`feat`/`fix`/`feat!` for shippable, a non-release type otherwise), pushes, opens a PR. Feature PRs land as **merge commits**; release-please ranks Conventional Commits on `main` (A-824). Conventional PR titles stay required (CI `validate-pr-title`) but are no longer the sole post-merge bump signal. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs build/lint, the conventional-PR-title lint, and the changelog-completeness gate on the PR.
2. After merge, **Clacks** (road-runner-bot, runs a 15-min cron) mints a short-lived repo-scoped App token, runs `release-please release-pr` (which infers the bump from Conventional Commits on `main` and writes `package.json` + `.release-please-manifest.json`), pushes the `release-please--branches--main` branch, and opens the "`chore(main): release <version>`" release PR. On a later tick it **squash-merges** that release PR once the CI gate is green — the `GO/NO GO` check-run (see "CI gate (`GO/NO GO`)" above). Fan-out PRs also stay squash.
3. The orchestrator's App-token merge pushes to `main`, re-firing `pkg-release.yml`: the `release` job publishes via the reusable workflow; the sibling `changelog-enrich` job (`mode: finalise`) fills post-merge changelog metadata and stamps `version` on the release cut (A-808). An unprivileged `build` job builds + `npm pack`s the tarball once and uploads it as an artifact; the `release` job sees a **freshly bumped, untagged version**, downloads that exact tarball, and publishes it to npm via OIDC Trusted Publishing (no token, no OTP) + provenance attestation, plus git tags + a GitHub release. A `publish-github-packages` job downloads the **same** tarball and mirrors it to GitHub Packages with a GitHub-native build-provenance attestation. All three publish jobs live in the shared `reusable-pkg-release.yml`; `pkg-release.yml` wires the inputs plus the enricher caller.

**The release workflow is publish-only.** It does **not** create the release PR — that path needs an identity that isn't `github-actions[bot]` (the "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" toggle is deliberately off), so versioning lives in the orchestrator where the App key stays private. A version-vs-tag detect step (in the reusable workflow) gates the publish: a feature-merge (version unchanged → its `v<version>` tag exists) is a clean green no-op; a release-PR merge (version freshly bumped → no tag yet) publishes. This keyless gate replaces the old `.changeset/*.md` scan — no Changesets dependency. The bot's private key never touches this public repo's CI.

**Cross-boundary hardening (A-326).** npm Trusted Publishing binds its OIDC subject to repository + workflow filename only — not the trigger event, ref, or actor — so anything able to run `pkg-release.yml` against an arbitrary ref could mint a valid publish credential. Three layers close that — one in the caller, one in repo settings, one upstream in the reusable workflow:

- **No `workflow_dispatch` (in the caller).** `pkg-release.yml`'s only trigger is `push: [main]`; re-run a failed release via "Re-run jobs" on the original push run. This lives in the caller — the reusable workflow can't stop a caller adding `workflow_dispatch`, so keep it out of `pkg-release.yml`.
- **Branch-restricted `npm-release` environment (repo settings).** Both privileged jobs in the reusable workflow (`release` and `publish-github-packages`) run under the `npm-release` environment, which permits deployments **only from `refs/heads/main`** (deployment-branch policy), so a non-main ref is rejected before the OIDC token is mintable. **No required reviewers** — releases stay hands-off; this is a structural ref gate, not a manual approval. The environment is configured in repo settings (not in YAML): `gh api -X PUT repos/rheged-studio/npm-package-template/environments/npm-release` with `deployment_branch_policy.custom_branch_policies=true`, then a single `main` branch policy.
- **Explicit ref guard (in the reusable workflow).** Every publish/tag step and the GitHub Packages job `if:` also carries `github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && …`. Redundant with the environment, but kept as the in-workflow structural defence. It lives upstream in `reusable-pkg-release.yml`, so a generated-repo operator verifies it there, not in the caller.

**Build once, publish the exact artifact (A-328).** Build-time code (`pnpm install` + `tsc` + `npm pack`) runs **only** in the unprivileged `build` job (`contents: read`, no `id-token`/`packages`/`contents: write`). Both publish legs download and ship that one tarball, so a compromised build-time dependency never runs alongside a mintable publish credential, and the npm tarball, the GitHub Packages tarball, and the attested digest are guaranteed byte-identical.

**The publish leg calls npm directly (no `changesets/action`).** The reusable workflow inlines the raw-npm publish — `npm publish "$TARBALL" --access public --provenance` on the prebuilt tarball (A-328) — rather than delegating to `pnpm`'s publish path. The template's `infrastructure/scripts/publish-via-raw-npm.sh` is the unit-tested **reference** for that logic (no longer CI-invoked since the reusable-workflow migration, like the `ensure-*.sh` scripts). Two reasons shaped it (both diagnosed in A-174):

- `actions/setup-node` runs after `pnpm/action-setup` and prepends its tool-cache bin to PATH, so plain `npm` resolves to whatever npm Node 22 ships. npm Trusted Publishing requires npm 11.5.1+. The upgrade-npm step works around this by `pnpm add -g npm@11.14.1` (pinned, not `@latest`, for CI reproducibility) and appending `$PNPM_HOME` to `$GITHUB_PATH` so subsequent steps see the upgraded npm at the front of PATH.
- The wrapper calls npm directly rather than via pnpm's own publish path, whose HTTP/OIDC implementation doesn't satisfy what npm Trusted Publishing expects. It is also idempotent: if `npm view name@version` succeeds, it exits 0 instead of re-publishing (which would 409).

The publish + tag steps run **only when the version-vs-tag gate reports a freshly bumped, untagged version** — i.e. solely to publish (npm + git tags + GitHub release). release-please (in the orchestrator) owns versioning and the release PR; the release workflow never bumps or tags speculatively.

**GitHub Packages — secondary target (A-323).** npmjs.org (OIDC + provenance) is the canonical public source; GitHub Packages is published alongside it as a secondary mirror with the security gaps closed:

- **Separate `publish-github-packages` job**, gated `needs: release` + `if: needs.release.outputs.should_publish == 'true'` **plus the same main-only ref guard + `npm-release` environment** (A-326). `packages: write` is scoped to this job only — never to the `release` job that holds `id-token: write` for npm OIDC.
- **Auth is the ephemeral per-job `GITHUB_TOKEN`** — the most secure option GitHub Packages offers (no OIDC Trusted-Publisher flow exists for it; no standing secret).
- **Provenance via GitHub-native attestation.** `npm publish --provenance` is npmjs.org-only, so the job runs `actions/attest-build-provenance` over the exact tarball it publishes — the attested digest matches both the npm tarball and what consumers download (`gh attestation verify <tarball> --repo rheged-studio/npm-package-template`).
- The GitHub Packages publish is idempotent (skips on `npm view` hit, distinguishes 404 from real errors) and **hard-codes the publish target to `https://npm.pkg.github.com`, aborting if the registry URL drifts from it** (A-330) — the ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a bearer credential, so the host must never be redirectable by a config edit. The template's `infrastructure/scripts/publish-to-github-packages.sh` is the unit-tested **reference** for that logic (now inlined in the reusable workflow, no longer CI-invoked).

> **Watch-item:** the npm leg's git tag + GitHub release are created explicitly in the reusable workflow's `release` job (`npm publish` creates neither on its own), sourcing the notes from the matching dated `changelog/` entries. Confirm that step still runs on each release.

Don't reintroduce `NPM_TOKEN` **as a CI secret** unless OIDC is verified broken. The local `.env`-based `NPM_TOKEN` is a different concern — it's for laptop-driven publishes only, never CI.

**Choosing the bump.** There is no changeset file. Feature PRs land as **merge commits**; release-please ranks Conventional Commits on `main` to decide the bump (A-824): `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, a `!` breaking marker (or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) → major. Conventional **PR titles** stay required (CI `validate-pr-title`) but are no longer the sole post-merge bump signal for feature work — commitlint / `validate-commits` remain the per-commit gate. `/send-it` still composes a Conventional Commits title; for a hand-opened PR, set the title yourself. The orchestrator still **squash-merges** the release PR; fan-out stays squash. Non-release types (`docs:`/`chore:`/`ci:`/`refactor:`/`test:`/`build:`/`style:`/`perf:`) don't cut a release. The conventional-PR-title lint + the changelog-completeness gate in `ci.yml` keep the PR-time title honest for the completeness coupling.

### Manual publish (break-glass — CI-down only, after the package exists)

> **This is break-glass, not a routine path (A-331).** Reach for it only when CI/OIDC is genuinely down — every normal release goes through `pkg-release.yml` (OIDC, no standing token). The `.env` `NPM_TOKEN` is a long-lived credential, so treat it accordingly: store it in a secrets manager retrieved just-in-time (not a lingering plaintext `.env`), give it the shortest viable lifetime with a documented rotation cadence, and rotate immediately on any exposure. It never touches CI, and manual publishes ship without a provenance badge so they can't masquerade as verified CI ones.

Auth setup (one-time, or after rotating your token):

```bash
NPM_TOKEN=$(grep '^NPM_TOKEN=' .env | cut -d'=' -f2-)
npm config set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken "$NPM_TOKEN"
npm whoami    # verify
```

The token must be a **Granular Access Token with the "Bypass 2FA" option enabled at creation time**. Without that flag, every publish hits `EOTP` and you're stuck. Tokens are immutable after creation — if you forgot the flag, revoke and regenerate.

Then publish:

```bash
pnpm run release:manual:dry    # simulate — verifies tarball + auth
pnpm run release:manual        # actual publish
```

`--provenance=false` is intentional — provenance attestation requires a GitHub Actions OIDC issuer, which a laptop doesn't have. Don't try `pnpm run release:manual -- --dry-run`; the chained-script + `--` separator confuses npm into treating `--dry-run` as a positional package spec. Use `release:manual:dry`.

## Bootstrap publish — read this when setting up a new package

The very first publish of a brand-new npm package **cannot go through CI**. Two reasons that compound:

- npm (unlike PyPI) has no pending-Trusted-Publisher flow. The package must exist on the registry before the Trusted Publisher form is reachable at `npmjs.com/package/<name>/access`.
- npm enforces 2FA at the publish endpoint for the first publish of a new package, irrespective of account/org/token bypass settings — so it needs an interactive second factor. A Granular bypass-2FA token does **not** help here: it only honours the bypass from publish #2 onwards. With a recent npm (default `auth-type=web`), that 2FA is satisfied **in the browser via a passkey/WebAuthn approval** — so the first publish completes interactively from a laptop, not in CI.

So bootstrap is always: manual first publish (approve in the browser) → create the `v<initial>` git tag + GitHub release → configure Trusted Publisher → CI takes over from publish #2.

**Pre-flight:**

- You belong to the target npm org with publish rights.
- npm CLI ≥ 11.5.1 (`npm install -g npm@latest`) — the floor Trusted Publishing needs; newer is better for the web-auth flow (verified on npm 11.12.1).
- **A passkey/security key registered on your npm account**, an interactive browser on the publishing machine, and `auth-type=web` (the npm default — don't override it). This is the primary path's second factor.
- _Fallback only:_ recovery codes generated and saved, for when no interactive browser/passkey is available (see the fallback below).
- `package.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json` are at the version you want to ship. For a brand-new package, edit both directly (set them to the initial `1.0.0`/`0.1.0`) — no release-please run is needed for the very first publish; release-please takes over bumping from publish #2 once the manifest is seeded.

**Sequence (primary — passkey/WebAuthn browser flow):**

1. Set `package.json` + `.release-please-manifest.json` to the version you want to ship (edit directly for a fresh package). There is no root `CHANGELOG.md` to write — the dated `changelog/` entry carries the release notes.
2. `pnpm run release:manual:dry` — verify tarball + auth. **Note:** dry-run does NOT exercise the 2FA/browser step, so a successful dry-run does not by itself predict a successful real publish.
3. `pnpm run release:manual` — i.e. `npm publish --access public --provenance=false` (no `--otp`). npm opens your browser and prompts for a **passkey/WebAuthn approval** (Touch ID / Face ID / security key). Approve it, and the brand-new scoped package publishes cleanly. _(Verified 2026-06-01 first-publishing `@rheged-studio/agent-skills@1.0.0` this way.)_
4. **Create the `v<initial>` git tag + GitHub release** for the version just published (A-1019). `release:manual` only publishes to npm — it does **not** create a git tag. Without the tag, release-please has no baseline and may open a spurious next bump that re-releases the already-shipped initial feature set. On `main` at the publish commit:

   ```bash
   VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
   git tag -a "v${VERSION}" -m "v${VERSION}"
   git push origin "v${VERSION}"
   gh release create "v${VERSION}" --title "v${VERSION}" --notes "Initial bootstrap publish."
   ```

   Prefer release notes from the matching dated `changelog/` entry when one exists (`gh release create … --notes-file <entry.md>`). Do **not** fold this into `release:manual` — that script is also the break-glass path after OIDC exists, where CI owns tagging.

5. Configure Trusted Publisher: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<name>/access` → GitHub Actions → org, repo, workflow filename (`pkg-release.yml`), environment blank.
6. From here on, releases go through CI cleanly.

**Fallback (recovery-code `--otp`):** for headless / CI-less / no-browser contexts, an account without a passkey, or an npm too old for web auth. Pass a recovery code as `--otp`:

```bash
npm publish --access public --provenance=false --otp=<recovery-code>
```

Generate codes at npmjs.com → Profile → Two-Factor Authentication → Manage Recovery Codes. Each is single-use. The format is a long hex string (not a 6-digit TOTP) — npm accepts it as `--otp` anyway. **After a publish that consumed a code, immediately regenerate your recovery codes** — the one you used is burnt. Then create the `v<initial>` tag + GitHub release (step 4) and configure Trusted Publisher (step 5) as above.

### Things that look like solutions but aren't

Saving these to spare the next bootstrap from rediscovering them:

- Toggling "Require 2FA for write actions" off in account settings.
- Disabling org-level 2FA enforcement.
- Generating a Granular token with bypass-2FA enabled — works for publish #2+, NOT publish #1.
- `oathtool` for generating TOTP — only works if you have a TOTP secret, and **npm has phased TOTP out of new accounts** (only passkeys + recovery codes are offered now).
- Disabling 2FA entirely — npm's policy _requires_ either 2FA or a bypass-2FA token; you can't disable both.

The passkey/WebAuthn browser flow is the answer for publish #1: with `auth-type=web` (the npm default) a plain `npm publish` opens the browser and lets you approve the package's first-publish 2FA interactively. Recovery-code `--otp` is the fallback for when there's no interactive browser or passkey to drive that flow.

> **Historical note:** earlier revisions of this runbook claimed the first publish would always fail with `EOTP` and that a recovery code passed as `--otp` was the only route — treating `npm publish --auth-type=web` as a no-op (a flag "only for `npm login`"). That was stale: as of npm 11.12.1, web auth is the default and `npm publish` completes first-publish 2FA in the browser via a passkey. Recovery-code `--otp` is now only the fallback.
