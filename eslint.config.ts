 * Self-lint config for the template, dogfooding the published Acme preset:
 * the `base` stack plus the TypeScript-file overrides.
 *
 * Authored in TypeScript (loaded by jiti) and wrapped in `defineConfig` so the
 * whole config array — including the local override blocks below — is
 * type-checked against the preset's shipped types, rather than only failing
 * when ESLint runs. Generated packages extend this with the opt-in presets they
 * need — e.g. `testing`, `frameworkRouting`, `astro`, `sanity`, `storybook`,
 * `tableComponents` — all re-exported from `@rheged-studio/eslint-config`.
