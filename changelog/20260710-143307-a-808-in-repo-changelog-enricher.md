title: "Adopt in-repo changelog enricher and wire it into the scaffold"
release_note: "Spawned packages inherit @acme-skunkworks/changelog-core, the pkg-release.yml changelog-enrich caller, and the Trunk road-runner-bot bypass from birth — no manual per-repo enricher setup."

## Added

- **`@acme-skunkworks/changelog-core`** as a devDependency, with `validate:changelog` and
  CI completeness pointing at `pnpm exec changelog-core …` ([A-808](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-808)).
- A **`changelog-enrich`** sibling job in `pkg-release.yml` calling
  `reusable-changelog-enrich.yml` (`mode: finalise`, pin `a87a5ba`) so post-merge
  metadata and version stamps land in-repo via road-runner-bot (ADR 0004 / [A-821](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-821)).
- **`ensureTrunkChangelogBypass`** in `initialise-package-repo` — creates or updates the
  repo-level Trunk ruleset with the road-runner-bot bypass so newly scaffolded packages
  inherit enricher write-back from birth.

## Changed

- Removed the vendored `infrastructure/scripts/*changelog*.ts` seam and matching tests;
  dropped `gray-matter` and `changelog:finalise`.
- Documented the post-merge enricher lifecycle in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`,
  `changelog/README.md`, and `infrastructure/README.md`.
