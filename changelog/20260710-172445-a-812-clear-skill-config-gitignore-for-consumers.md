## Fixed

- `/initialise-package-repo` strips `.claude/skills/*/config.json` and
  `.agents/skills/*/config.json` (and the accompanying comment) from `.gitignore`
  during post-generation setup, so `initialise-skills` can write **trackable**
  configs the consumer commits ([A-812](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-812)).
- Corrected `CLAUDE.md` and the template `.gitignore` comment: resolved skill
  `config.json` is generated on install then **committed** in consumers; the
  ignore remains only as a template-seed guard so "Use this template" does not
  copy local configs.

## Changed

- Bumped the repo-local `initialise-package-repo` skill to `0.4.0` (both Claude
  Code and Cursor trees) with tests for the strip planner.
