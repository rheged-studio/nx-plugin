## Changed

- Removed the `merge_strategy` field from the frontmatter schema block in
  `changelog/README.md`. The Simple changelog project dropped `merge_strategy`
  from the changelog contract ([A-802](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-802))
  and the in-repo `changelog-core` model no longer records it, so the documented
  schema no longer advertises a field that repos scaffolded from this template
  would otherwise inherit as stale ([A-950](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-950)).
