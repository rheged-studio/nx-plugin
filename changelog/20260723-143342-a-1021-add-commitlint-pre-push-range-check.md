## Added

- Best-effort `commitlint --from origin/main --to HEAD` check in `.husky/pre-push`
  ([A-1021](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1021)), alongside the existing
  yamllint/actionlint steps. Skips with an installation hint when `@commitlint/cli` is
  missing or when `origin/main` is not a resolvable ref; bypassable with
  `git push --no-verify`. Complements CI's `reusable-validate-commits` gate rather than
  replacing it.
- `commitlint.config.mjs` extending `@acme-skunkworks/commitlint-config`.
- `@commitlint/cli` and `@acme-skunkworks/commitlint-config` as devDependencies for the
  local range check.

## Changed

- Documented the pre-push commitlint range check in `CLAUDE.md`.
