## Added

- An `npm` package ecosystem in `.github/dependabot.yml`
  ([A-980](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-980)), grouped weekly so one lockfile
  churn lands or reverts atomically. Its `commit-message` template sets `prefix`,
  `prefix-development` and `include: scope`, so bumps read `chore(deps): …` and
  `chore(deps-dev): …`. Setting both prefixes matters: `prefix` alone leaves
  development-dependency bumps on Dependabot's own default subject, which is not
  Conventional and would fail the commit gate once it becomes a required check.

## Notes

- The existing `github-actions` ecosystem is deliberately **unchanged**: its `prefix: "ci"`
  already produces `ci(deps): …`, which is Conventional, semantically accurate for workflow
  bumps, and consistent across the estate. `chore` is reserved for the npm ecosystem so the
  two remain distinguishable; both are no-release types, so neither cuts a version alone.
- Until now this repo had no npm ecosystem at all, so its dev toolchain was never bumped by
  Dependabot.
- Repos spawned from this template inherit the corrected config, so new repos start compliant.
