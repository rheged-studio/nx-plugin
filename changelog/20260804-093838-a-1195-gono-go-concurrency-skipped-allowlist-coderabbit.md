## Changed

**GO/NO GO gate hardening and CodeRabbit walkthrough summary ([A-1195](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1195))**

- `ci.yml` / `validate-pr-title.yml` — upgrade the [A-961](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-961) carve-out to `cancel-in-progress: false` ([A-1100](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1100))
- `ci.yml` GO/NO GO verdict — branch-conditional `skipped` allowlist (release-please only) ([A-1103](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1103))
- `.coderabbit.yaml` — `high_level_summary_in_walkthrough: true` ([A-1102](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1102))
