# Publish the current package to GitHub Packages (npm.pkg.github.com) as a
# secondary target (A-323; reinstates the leg dropped in A-320 / #49).
#
# Auth: GitHub Packages has no OIDC Trusted-Publisher flow, so this uses the
# automatic per-job GITHUB_TOKEN — the most secure option GitHub Packages
# offers (ephemeral, scoped to this repo, no standing secret). It needs no
# OIDC, so plain `npm` (token auth works on any npm version) and no
# --provenance flag. Relies on the preceding actions/setup-node (GitHub
# Packages) step having written .npmrc; auth comes from NODE_AUTH_TOKEN.
#
# Provenance is NOT carried via `npm publish --provenance` — that uploads the
# attestation to npm's registry attestation API, which is npmjs.org-only.
# Instead the workflow runs actions/attest-build-provenance over the exact
# tarball this script publishes, producing a GitHub-native attestation
# verifiable with `gh attestation verify`. To keep the attested and published
# digests identical, we publish the prebuilt $TARBALL rather than letting
# `npm publish` re-pack.
#
# Idempotent: if package@version already exists on GitHub Packages, exit 0
# instead of re-publishing (which would 409). Combined with the workflow's
# pending-changesets gate, this keeps retries and any non-release run safe.
#
# Inputs (all from env, set by the workflow):
#   NODE_AUTH_TOKEN              — GitHub Packages auth (the GITHUB_TOKEN); read
#                                  from .npmrc by npm
#   GITHUB_PACKAGES_REGISTRY_URL — registry to target, from
#                                  infrastructure/repo-config.yaml (A-176)
#   TARBALL                      — path to the .tgz produced by `npm pack` and
#                                  attested by the workflow; this exact file is
#                                  published so its digest matches the attestation
#
# Reads ./package.json for the package name and version.
