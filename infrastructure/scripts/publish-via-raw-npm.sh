# Publish the current package to npm via the upgraded npm at $PNPM_HOME/npm.
# CI-unused since A-639: the shared reusable-pkg-release.yml now inlines the
# equivalent publish logic. Retained as the unit-tested REFERENCE for that flow
# (like the ensure-*.sh scripts). Calling npm directly rather than `pnpm publish`:
# diagnosed in A-174, pnpm's publish path fails OIDC Trusted Publishing even
# when `$PNPM_HOME` is on $PATH and `which npm` correctly resolves to npm 11.x.
# Calling npm directly works (PR #19 proved the npm-side flow when the workflow
# filename matches the TP allowlist on npmjs.com).
#
# Idempotent: if the package@version already exists on npm, exit 0 instead
# of re-publishing (which would 403/409) — so a retry is safe after the version
# commit lands but before npm has the artifact.
#
# Publishes the prebuilt $TARBALL (A-328) rather than re-packing the working
# tree, so the npm tarball, the GitHub Packages tarball, and the attested digest
# are byte-identical — and no build-time code runs in this credential-holding
# job. `--provenance` still works on a prebuilt tarball: npm derives the
# provenance statement from the GHA OIDC token + run context, not from a re-run
# build.
#
# Inputs (all from env, set by the workflow):
#   PNPM_HOME — directory containing the upgraded npm binary
#   TARBALL   — path to the .tgz built and uploaded by the unprivileged build
#               job, downloaded here as an artifact
#
# Reads ./package.json for the package name and version.
