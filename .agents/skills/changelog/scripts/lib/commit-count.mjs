// Resolve a merged PR's commit count EXCLUDING merge commits, via the GitHub
// REST commits endpoint. Shared by finalise-changelog (release-time enrichment)
// and backfill-commits (the one-off backlog backfill) — A-560.
//
// Trunk merge strategy does not change the API or count semantics — only where
// the landing commit lives:
//
// - **Squash:** the PR collapses to one commit on trunk, so the per-commit
//   count is lost from local Git history — but the PR commits endpoint still
//   returns the original branch commits post-merge, so the count stays
//   recoverable.
// - **Merge commit:** trunk gets a two-parent merge commit (`mergeCommit.oid`);
//   the PR commits endpoint still lists every commit that was on the branch,
//   including any branch-side merge-resolution commits (those with >1 parent).
//
// In both cases, excluding merge commits (more than one parent) drops
// `main`-merge resolution commits so the count reflects authored work rather
// than branch upkeep; the REST commit object's `parents` array is the reliable
// signal (`gh pr view --json commits` omits parent data).
//
// Runner-injectable `(cmd, args) -> stdout`, mirroring finalise-changelog's
// makeResolver, so it's unit-testable with a fake runner and never reaches the
// network in tests. `gh api --paginate` substitutes `{owner}`/`{repo}` from the
// repo's remote and merges the paged arrays, so PRs with more than one page of
// commits still count correctly.

/**
 * Count a merged PR's commits, excluding merge commits (more than one parent).
 * @param {(cmd: string, args: string[]) => string} run command runner
 * @param {number | string} prNumber merged PR number
 * @returns {null | string} the non-merge commit count as a string, or null when the response isn't an array. Throws (rather than returning null) if the gh output isn't valid JSON — a network/auth failure must surface to the caller, not be silently recorded as a count; both callers own that (finalise-changelog's resolver and backfill's main() each wrap the call).
